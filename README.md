# pythonRoboBrowserTest
NOT robo browser module, swapped to selenium


https://readthedocs.org/projects/robobrowser/downloads/pdf/latest/

pip install Werkzeug==0.9.6 if you get the import error, AFTER doing pip install selenium

Goals:
- error handling/logging
- storepc primary key, probably needs to be treated like date primary key 
- maybe swap to object oriented
